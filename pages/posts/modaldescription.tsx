We’ve all been there. We know the helpline is never straightforward. An automated operator leads us into a maze of menus with bewildering choices. All we want is to speak to somebody, but these machines dominate the narrative of our needs and leave us on hold for an eternity.<br/>
<br/>
Through movement, monologues and live music, Thank You For Holding will take the audience through a journey that’s embedded in mystery and uncertainty. Like each phone encounter, we will never know how the call would end up.<br/>
<br/>
This is a participatory performance where the audience chooses how the performance unfolds. Each choice offers further categories and subcategories and triggers a different response, some in the form of a story, others in the form of questions and still others in the form of a confession.<br/>
<br/>
Thank You For Holding is a multidisciplinary performance written and directed by Marc Nair in collaboration with Sudhee Liao (choreography), Mantravine (music), Audrey Ng and Low Zi Hao (art direction). Featuring Arunditha, Chan Hsin Yee and Jack Ng. Voiceovers by Carolyn Oei and Marc Nair.  <br/>
